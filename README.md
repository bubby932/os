# The Rosehip operating system
This is a hobby project by @bubby932, written exclusively for x86 processors in 16-bit real mode (i.e post 8086), in raw assembly and [Davis](https://github.com/bubby932/davis-lang).

# Update - 05/11/2022
Rosehip is being completely overhauled from scratch, in 64-bit long mode with a full kernel and more. If you're interested, contact me on Discord with any questions at Rose932#1454.
